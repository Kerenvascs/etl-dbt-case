# Notes about the data ELT process:

The SQL DB uses timestamp as its datatype. 
This is innately different from the Unix TimeStamp(which is a number). 
You cannot store a Unix TimeStamp in a SQL Timestamp field. 
You can store the date that you want and then Cast of Convert it upon display or integration. 
You could create a conversion function to accomplish this and call that function when you need the SQL timestamp converted.

 #Assuming the psql command-line tool, you may use \copy instead of copy.

\copy opens the file and feeds the contents to the server, whereas copy tells the server the open the file itself and read it, 
which may be problematic permission-wise, 
or even impossible if client and server run on different machines with no file sharing in-between.

-> pass volume to docker

# problems related to unix nanoseconds conversions
couldt insert data direct into table as timstamp. Had to insert as string, format then convert to timestamp.

#SQL Error [22P04]: ERROR: extra data after last expected column
